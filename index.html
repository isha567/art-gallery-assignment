          <p>
            The famous French artist Claude Monet was one of the most celebrated
            Impressionists whose nature paintings are well known in the history
            of art. Investigating the shifting nature of light and the
            perception of pure color, his paintings defined the Impressionistic
            style. His famous Water Lilies series, along with his paintings
            Haystacks and Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe (inspired by Manet's
            masterpiece), showcase the new technique – en plein air. Taking his
            easel outside, Claude Monet was one of many Impressionist and
            Post-Impressionist artists who promoted the direct contact to nature
            and used it to develop new trends in painting.

          <p>
            The self-taught American artist Winslow Homer initially worked as a
            commercial illustrator. Fascinated with nature, he began
            investigating the traditional oil medium and soon became famous for
            his landscape and marine subjects produced during his working
            vacations. His nature painting Gloucester Harbor showcases the
            beauty of color, the shifting light, and the serene atmosphere of
            the vacation at the sea. Other nature-inspired paintings by the
            artist include the Sunlight on the Coast, part of the collection of
            the Ohio Toledo Museum of Art, Song of the Lark, and Cloud Shadows.

            The Oxbow (The Connecticut River Near Northampton) - Thomas Cole
          </h2>
          <p>
            The American painter Thomas Cole is credited to be the founder of
            the Hudson River School. The school was the base of the 19th-century
            movement created by a number of landscape artists whose aesthetic
            vision was influenced by Romanticism. This traditional period
            promoted the wild and expressive qualities that nature held to
            represent the setting for deeper philosophical themes. Cole was
            famous for his realistic and beautiful paintings of America’s rugged
            wilderness, as displayed in his Distant View of the Niagara Falls,
            Home in the Woods, and The Oxbow. For many his paintings are a form
            of allegorical art as they often hide themes which extend from the
            mere nature depictions.
